You agree that any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, the applicability of these Terms of Use to the use of this Site, or purchase of any DezLin or other products on this Site, or to breach or enforcement, interpretation or validity of these Terms of Use, or the determination of the scope or applicability of Arbitration shall be governed solely by the Federal Arbitration Act.If you and DezLin cannot resolve a dispute informally, any dispute asserted by either party will be resolved only by binding Arbitration. By agreeing to Arbitration, both you and DezLin understand and agree that all disputes shall be decided by an Arbitrator and that you are waiving your rights to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle disputes. Instead of suing in court, both you and DezLin each agree to resolve disputes (except certain small claims) only by Arbitration. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. The rules in Arbitration are different. There is no judge or jury, and review is limited, but an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief, and must honor the same limitations stated in these Terms of Use as a court would.The Arbitration will be conducted under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures (referred to as the “JAMS Rules”) and under the rules set forth in these Terms of Use. If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms of Use, the rules set forth in these Terms of Use will govern. You may, in Arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to the law of the governing state. If you decide to initiate Arbitration, DezLin agrees to pay the Arbitration initiation fee and any additional required deposit required by JAMS to initiate your Arbitration. You and DezLin agree to pay the costs of the Arbitration proceeding provided however that if you are a consumer you shall not be required to pay more than $250.00 of the fees or such amount as the JAMS Rules may later prescribe. All other fees, such as attorneys’ fees and expenses of travel to the Arbitration, will be paid in accordance with JAMS Rules. The Arbitration will be held at a location in your home town area if possible, unless you and DezLin both agree to another location or telephonic Arbitration. To initiate Arbitration, you or DezLin must do the following things:(1) Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the dispute and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.(2) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to:JAMS [to your local JAMS office or to JAMS, 620 Eighth Ave., 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018].(3) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.Special Rules in the Arbitration Proceeding. (i) The arbitrator has no authority to make errors of law and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator does so. Otherwise, the arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on all parties and may be enforced in any Federal or State court that has jurisdiction. (ii) Neither you nor DezLin shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in Arbitration by or against other individuals or entities, or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity. THIS MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO INITIATE OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION WHATSOEVER. Accordingly, you and DezLin agree that the JAMS Class Action Procedures do not apply to our Arbitration. A court may sever any portion of this dispute resolution provision if it finds such unenforceable, except for the prohibition on class, representative and private attorney general arbitrations. Notwithstanding the obligation to arbitrate all disputes under these Terms of Use, you may assert an individual dispute in small claims court in lieu of Arbitration.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">14. choice of law and time to bring your claim<br></span><br>You agree that any dispute will be governed by the law of the State of California and that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related to, or connected with your use of the Company’s website, its products, or these Terms of Use, must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever banned.IF YOU ARE A CONSUMER, HOWEVER, THIS PROVISION SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED TO LIMIT YOUR RIGHTS UNDER CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS OF YOUR STATE OF RESIDENCE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 15.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">15. exclusions and limitations; consumer protection notice<br></span><br>If you are a consumer, the provisions in these Terms of Use are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as is permitted by the laws of your State of residence.

In any event, DezLin reserves all rights, defenses and permissible limitations under the law of your State of residence.

We also accept any links showing you are actively selling such as a website, Facebook, TikTok, etc. However, a link must show you are ACTIVELY selling. We do not accept links to businesses that just created a social media account. There is no way for us to know you are a timely selling. If you are just starting out and you have no documentation whatsoever we will not be able to approve your account. This is to prevent your future customers from receiving your pricing and this protects our current wholesale clients.&nbsp;<br><br>5. ARE ALL VERIFIED COMPANIES APPROVED?<br><br>Unfortunately, no. We do not approve every company. Companies we sell to must be within our industry. Landscaping and realty businesses are examples of business owners we would not approve. Tumbler companies is a business in the gray area where we make decisions based on internal reasons and discretions. Exact requirements vary from company to company and will be on a case by case basis</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script>
